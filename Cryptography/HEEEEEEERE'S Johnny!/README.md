## Question
>Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with `` nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 38860 ``. Files can be found here: [passwd](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/29633d1bd5ba677d6af455cf61b18f57/passwd) [shadow](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/29633d1bd5ba677d6af455cf61b18f57/shadow).

### Hint
>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And again. And again.
>If you're not careful these kind of problems can really "rockyou".
