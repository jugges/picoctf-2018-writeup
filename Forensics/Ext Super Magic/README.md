## Question
>We salvaged a ruined Ext SuperMagic II-class mech recently and pulled the [filesystem](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/bef2a485087cc9842099ac9bd3e0041f/ext-super-magic.img) out of the black box.  It looks a bit corrupted, but maybe there's something interesting in there. You can also find it in /problems/ext-super-magic_3_debae27da9f20eec855067f3e83b45f3 on the shell server.

### Hint
>Are there any [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck) for diagnosing corrupted filesystems?  What do they say if you run them on this one?
>How does a linux machine know what [type](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html) of file a [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) is?
>You might find this [doc](http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html) helpful.
>Be careful with [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) when making edits.
>Once you've fixed the corruption, you can use /sbin/[debugfs](https://linux.die.net/man/8/debugfs) to pull the flag file out.
