## Question
>Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/b3e4e30f1c9d3fdd1ce245c849187c36/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0_1_316c391426b9319fbdfb523ee15b37db on the shell server. [Source](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/b3e4e30f1c9d3fdd1ce245c849187c36/vuln.c).

### Hint
>How can you trigger the flag to print?
>If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
