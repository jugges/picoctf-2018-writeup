## Question
>This [program](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/3f9baed3a53fe9962f7bd7b14b58d07e/vuln) gives you the address of some system calls. Can you get a shell? You can find the program in /problems/got-2-learn-libc_1_ceda86bc09ce7d6a0588da4f914eb833 on the shell server. [Source](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/3f9baed3a53fe9962f7bd7b14b58d07e/vuln.c).

### Hint
>try returning to systems calls to leak information
>don't forget you can always return back to main()
