## Question
>Using a debugging tool will be extremely useful on your missions. Can you run this [program](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/da4354bbe8d7772aa4bd34003211b6c5/run) in gdb and find the flag? You can find the file in /problems/learn-gdb_1_a2decdea3e89bfcdcbd9de1a67ceed0e on the shell server.

### Hint
>Try setting breakpoints in gdb
>Try and find a point in the program after the flag has been read into memory to break on
>Where is the flag being written in memory?
