## Question
>In a filesystem, everything is relative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Can you find a way to get a flag from this [program](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/725b533a89a0e70b85b37ce2965da003/absolutely-relative)? You can find it in /problems/absolutely-relative_2_69862edfe341b57b6ed2c62c7107daee on the shell server.

### Hint
>Do you have to run the program in the same directory? (⊙.☉)7
>Ever used a text editor? Check out the program 'nano'
