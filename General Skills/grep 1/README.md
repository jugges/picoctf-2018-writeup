## Question
>Can you find the flag in [file](//2018shell.picoctf.com/static/805ac70722810caa0b1c02bc88ef68d8/file)? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_0_c0c0c16438cdbee39591397e16389f59 on the shell server.
