## Question
>Do you see the same things I see? The glimpses of the flag hidden away? http://2018shell.picoctf.com:10157

### Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
Obviously the name of this challenge along with the hint of this challenge beg us to visit `robots.txt`:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /143ce.html
```
Which begs to visit `143ce.html` that uncovers our flag.

### Flag
`picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_143ce}`
