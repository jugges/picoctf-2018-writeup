## Question
>One of my school mate developed an alive monitoring tool. Can you get a flag from `` http://2018shell.picoctf.com:31070 `` ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:31070))?

### Hint
>This application uses the validation check both on the client side and on the server side, but the server check seems to be inappropriate.
>You should be able to listen through the shell on the server.
